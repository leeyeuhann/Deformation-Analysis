# Deformation-Analysis

Analysis for nuclear deformation in cells grown on nanopillars. Compares z-stack intensity between 1 by 1 square drawn on pillar and 3 by 3 square around it representing background readings across multiple pillars within single nucleus for each cell at each timepoint, and returns a table of the maximum intensity and its corresponding z-value.
